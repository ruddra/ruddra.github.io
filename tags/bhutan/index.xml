It was my best trip ever, really ever. From Dhaka, we went there by DRUK AIR. We(me and two of my friends) landed in Paro Airport. It was really wonderful airport, it was small but clean and organised. After getting out of the plan, a chilling air struck us, and instantly we knew, we gonna like this country.</description></item></channel></rss>
