Ideally you should have the database running in a separate container and use network to interact with that container.
Usually, we donâ€™t ship application with the database inside the same container. But sometimes we are forced to do that. In this article we are going to see a minimalist way of shipping application with database built-in inside docker container.</description></item><item><title>Use Docker for Accessing Database in AWS CodeBuild</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/aws-codebuild-use-database/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 19:08:29 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/aws-codebuild-use-database/</guid><description>AWS CodeBuild is an extraordinary tool for building your code. Recently I have been using it to build projects and store docker images in AWS ECR. During those CodeBuild processes, I needed Database for running tests. As the need of the Database was for a limited time and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay extra for it(that is why I did not use AWS RDS), I decided to create database using docker inside CodeBuild.</description></item><item><title>Basic Networking in Docker</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/networking-with-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:50:56 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/networking-with-docker/</guid><description>We already know that Docker is used for containerization. But networking in docker makes it even better tool for deployment. You can make standalone deployments in containers and communicate between them, or make containers act as host, or even assign mac addresses to containers and act them as devices. It does not matter which host machine you are in, you can make dockers communicate in-between them.</description></item><item><title>Tips on Using Volume, Entrypoint and Ignore Files in Docker</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/docker-volume-entrypoint-ignorefile/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 00:56:04 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/docker-volume-entrypoint-ignorefile/</guid><description>Have you worked with Docker before? Do you think you have trouble with it, like when you are developing an application, you need to build every time to see the results, or thinking of the best way to load data in DB, or may be you are annoyed because there are lots of markdown files, screenshots etc that are taking a lot of space in your container.</description></item><item><title>Tips on Using Docker Compose, Build Argument and Environment Variable</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/docker-compose-arg-env/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/docker-compose-arg-env/</guid><description>Imagine, you have some microservices and you want to use API from one service to another, how can you do that if all of them are running in different docker container? Docker Compose has a solution for you.
Suppose you want to deploy a project in test, stage and production environment with same Dockerfile for all of them through a single Dockerfile.</description></item><item><title>Tips on Writing Dockerfile, Reduce Sizes and Build Time of Docker Image</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/docker-write-dockerfile-and-reduce-size-build-time-for-image/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 00:15:22 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/docker-write-dockerfile-and-reduce-size-build-time-for-image/</guid><description>For the past couple of years, I have been creating Dockerfile for different projects. based on those experiences I am going to share some tips on writing docker files to communication between containers.
