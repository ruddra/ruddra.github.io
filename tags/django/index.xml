Usually they are in json output, yaml output, XML output, GeoJSON output etc text based formats.
Here, we are going to supercharge these serializers to do more things, even try to render properties method and instance method.</description></item><item><title>Deploy Django App in Sub Directory Using OpenShift</title><link>https://ruddra.com/deploy-django-app-in-sub-directory-using-openshift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 20:36:44 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/deploy-django-app-in-sub-directory-using-openshift/</guid><description>When you are using OpenShift, you will be using routes to expose a route from a service. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to expose a path in example.com/dummy. When you do that for a django application(without any reverse proxy server), it usually becomes a problem, because the sub directory does not work well with Django&amp;rsquo;s urls.</description></item><item><title>Do Extra in S3 Using Django Storage and Boto3</title><link>https://ruddra.com/do-extra-in-s3-using-django-storage-and-boto3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2019 01:49:10 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/do-extra-in-s3-using-django-storage-and-boto3/</guid><description>Today, I am going to write about few useful snippets/functionalities which I have used for Amazon S3 or any S3 compitable storage using Boto3 and Django Storage.

For example, sometimes it returns a string(ie. abcd), sometimes it returns a list(ie. [1,2,3,4]), or maybe None. Now, you are suppose to save that data, which you can&amp;rsquo;t predict.
