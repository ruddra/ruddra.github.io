It is pretty handy because it generates the table of content without help of any JavaScript or CSS code. But there is a problem with it, you need to put it inside templates. You can&amp;rsquo;t render it inside the contents of the markdown file.</description></item><item><title>Reduce Build Time for Docker Image with Data Science Packages</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/docker-reduce-build-time-for-data-science-packages/<pubdate>Sun, 24 May 2020 00:36:27 +0600</pubdate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/docker-reduce-build-time-for-data-science-packages/</guid><description>If you want to use data science packages like numpy, scipy, pandas etc with your docker container and using pip to install them, then it will take forever to build the images. Because pip compiles the C extended code and that compilation needs a lot of time. For numpy it took me around 4 minutes.</description></item><item><title>Create an Application with JWT based Authentication in 10 Minutes using Django</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/django-jwt-auth-app-in-10-mins/<pubdate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0600</pubdate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/django-jwt-auth-app-in-10-mins/</guid><description>Let us say, you need an authentication service in a rush, which needs to be cutting edge and uses JWT based authentication.

Even using WebHook is pretty easy. You can start a build in CodeBuild for every push, pull, PR created, PR merged etc. But it can be bit tricky when it comes to trigger for every tag push only, as it us not a default event type provided by CodeBuild.</description></item><item><title>Hugo: Use Environment Variable in Markdown Files</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/hugo-use-env-variable-in-md/<pubdate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0600</pubdate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/hugo-use-env-variable-in-md/</guid><description>Hugo is a fantastic framework to generate static site from markdown and serve them.

Back in the old days(even now-a-days), you needed to override every componentDidMount method in class based components to see if the user is authenticated. In the latest ReactJS, there are hooks(specially useEffect) where you need to write these checks. Either way, some codes will be redundant.</description></item><item><title>Use Docker for Accessing Database in AWS CodeBuild</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/aws-codebuild-use-database/<pubdate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 19:08:29 +0600</pubdate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/aws-codebuild-use-database/</guid><description>AWS CodeBuild is an extraordinary tool for building your code.

But networking in docker makes it even better tool for deployment. You can make standalone deployments in containers and communicate between them, or make containers act as host, or even assign mac addresses to containers and act them as devices. It does not matter which host machine you are in, you can make dockers communicate in-between them.</description></item><item><title>Implement Newsletter Subscription Using Staticman</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/implement-newsletters-using-staticman/<pubdate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:12:08 +0600</pubdate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/implement-newsletters-using-staticman/</guid><description>In this article, I am going to share how you can set up a newsletter subscription using Staticman.
