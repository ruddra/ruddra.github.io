Ideally you should have the database running in a separate container and use network to interact with that container.
Usually, we donâ€™t ship application with the database inside the same container. But sometimes we are forced to do that. In this article we are going to see a minimalist way of shipping application with database built-in inside docker container.</description></item></channel></rss>
