Even using WebHook is pretty easy. You can start a build in CodeBuild for every push, pull, PR created, PR merged etc. But it can be bit tricky when it comes to trigger for every tag push only, as it us not a default event type provided by CodeBuild.</description></item><item><title>Hugo: Deploy Static Site using GitHub Actions</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/hugo-deploy-static-page-using-github-actions/<pubdate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 00:59:54 +0600</pubdate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/hugo-deploy-static-page-using-github-actions/</guid><description>If you are using Hugo to generate static pages, you are familiar with CLI commands which are to build the static pages in your local machine and make push to your &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io repository. When it comes to using Hugo for blogging, compared to platforms like Medium or WordPress, it is very painful because you do not have any web interface to make changes whenever you want or wherever you want.</description></item><item><title>Use Docker for Accessing Database in AWS CodeBuild</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/aws-codebuild-use-database/<pubdate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 19:08:29 +0600</pubdate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/aws-codebuild-use-database/</guid><description>AWS CodeBuild is an extraordinary tool for building your code. Recently I have been using it to build projects and store docker images in AWS ECR. During those CodeBuild processes, I needed Database for running tests. As the need of the Database was for a limited time and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay extra for it(that is why I did not use AWS RDS), I decided to create database using docker inside CodeBuild.</description></item><item><title>Writing Jenkins Pipeline For OpenShift Deployment: Part Two</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/openshift-python-jenkins-pipeline-two/<pubdate>Sat, 11 Aug 2018 20:41:04 +0000</pubdate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/openshift-python-jenkins-pipeline-two/</guid><description>In previous article, we covered step 1-5 which would prepare the code and make sure it is ready to be deployed to OpenShift.

Jenkins Pipeline is simply writing these instructions in Jenkins. These pipelines can be written in Groovy. In previous post we have defined deployment structure and made necessary preparations for deployment of a python+gunicorn+nginx+jenkins based project.</description></item><item><title>Deploy Django to OpenShift Using Jenkins Pipeline(CI/CD)</title><link>https://ruddra.com/posts/django-openshift-pipeline/<pubdate>Sun, 22 Jul 2018 17:51:20 +0000</pubdate><guid>https://ruddra.com/posts/django-openshift-pipeline/</guid><description>Using Jenkins pipeline, you can easily automate your deployments in openshift. In this post, we are going to use this powerful tool to deploy a Django project. But before we start, one thing I need to mention is that, this project has been tested on in Minishift 1.2.0, OpenShift v3.9.0 and Kubernetes v1.</description></item></channel></rss>
