It is pretty handy because it generates the table of content without help of any JavaScript or CSS code. But there is a problem with it, you need to put it inside templates. You can&amp;rsquo;t render it inside the contents of the markdown file.</description></item><item><title>Reduce Build Time for Docker Image with Data Science Packages</title><link>https://ruddra.com/reduce-build-time-for-docker-image-with-data-science-packages/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 00:36:27 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/reduce-build-time-for-docker-image-with-data-science-packages/</guid><description>If you want to use data science packages like numpy, scipy, pandas etc with your docker container and using pip to install them, then it will take forever to build the images.

Ideally you should have the database running in a separate container and use network to interact with that container.
Usually, we don’t ship application with the database inside the same container. But sometimes we are forced to do that. In this article we are going to see a minimalist way of shipping application with database built-in inside docker container.</description></item><item><title>Maintain Authentication Layer from Redux Middleware Using React Router</title><link>https://ruddra.com/maintain-authentication-layer-from-redux-middleware-using-react-router/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2020 01:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/maintain-authentication-layer-from-redux-middleware-using-react-router/</guid><description>Maintaining authentication layer in ReactJS can be painful.

Recently I have been using it to build projects and store docker images in AWS ECR. During those CodeBuild processes, I needed Database for running tests.

But networking in docker makes it even better tool for deployment. You can make standalone deployments in containers and communicate between them, or make containers act as host, or even assign mac addresses to containers and act them as devices. It does not matter which host machine you are in, you can make dockers communicate in-between them.</description></item><item><title>Implement Newsletter Subscription Using Staticman</title><link>https://ruddra.com/implement-newsletter-subscription-using-staticman/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:12:08 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ruddra.com/implement-newsletter-subscription-using-staticman/</guid><description>In this article, I am going to share how you can set up a newsletter subscription using Staticman.
